 
Queue is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at two different ends. In a queue data structure, adding and removing of elements are performed at two different positions. The insertion is performed at one end and deletion is performed at other end. In a queue data structure, the insertion operation is performed at a position which is known as 'rear' and the deletion operation is performed at a position which is known as 'front'. In queue data structure, the insertion and deletion operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

In a queue data structure, the insertion operation is performed using a function called "**enQueue()**" and deletion operation is performed using a function called "**deQueue()**".

Queue data structure can be defined as follows...

**_Queue data structure is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO principle._**

A queue can also be defined as

**_"Queue data structure is a collection of similar data items in which insertion and deletion operations are performed based on FIFO principle"._**
